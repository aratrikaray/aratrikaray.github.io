					<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:darkgray; font-weight: 300; font-size: large">I am Aratrika Ray-Dowling.  On this portfolio website I showcase my fine-arts projects which I have been making since 2009. I am not an artist by profession but I make art projects in my leisure. Making art gives me a sense of freedom to express myself when words fall short and it also soothes my mind when I feel lost. You will peek into my creative end if you are reading this page. Sometimes I need to be pretty bold in flaunting this passion of my art-making as there are stereotypes which dictates that an engineer cannot be an artist or in other words if they are artists then in no way they are good engineers! Well, luckily I did not face a person yet who expressed this stereotype on my face but I am aware that this thought process exists. Making art beside my original profession is such a refreshment that I ignore such stereotypes which bind me to a box! So I create whenever I feel like and whenever I can. Art did not just appear to me one day! I got training from professionals since a very tender age. My parents always insisted that I would take interest in different activities beyond my formal education. They had exposed me to different cultural counterparts and art was one of those. There was also an unsaid pressure from school-work that needed students to make scientific diagrams. The better the diagrams are the better the grades will be! The education system in India together with parenting structure usually make children look into different activities beyond studies. When I was around 5-6 years old a time came when those scientific diagrams would haunt me. A lot of my friends already started taking training from art schools but I was yet to start. I remember my first scientific diagram was water cycle whose neatness took me a lot of time to grasp. I expressed to my parents that I need to do good in those diagrams. My father taught me that while they search for a good art school for my age I can draw with dots and then later on join them to make the final neat diagram. This way erasing a few dots will be easier and I can divide my diagram into smaller pieces. That worked well for a while but later I realized that it was taking a long time! I remember I was little and couldn’t draw 6 domestic animals as part of our life science assignment. I remember that I was up all Friday night as I have never drawn an animal figure and I wondered how will I draw all 6 in my interleaf workbook. The assignment was due on Monday! </p>
					<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:darkgray; font-weight: 300; font-size: large">I was 6 years old when I first got in an art school ran by Mr. Nihar Chowdhury. He used to give us full freedom to draw whatever our hearts desired and then corrected them once we were done. He never scolded and he always had a smile in his face. I remember him saying at times, “how did you do this? I don’t think I can!”. He suggested my parents that I seemed to be very skeptical about drawing and thus at that point this class should not be a formal regulation. So for me and some other little kids he waived the yearly drawing test. We used to be there to draw, watch different students’ art of various ages, and to learn new tactics from him. As per my parents that school was a lot more fun than they expected and maybe I am not learning much except being in that weekly class on Saturday morning where I am drawing whatever my heart wishes. Thus, I joined another art school at the age of 9 ran by Mr. Prasanth   Mullick but left it after a year or so. I improved a lot even in that short span. My parents observed that I am no more scared of drawing and that my scientific diagrams are no more a nightmare! So it’s time to give all curricular activities a gap and focus on studies. A few years went by since then. I was 13 when my father again thought that I should now start getting a formal training from an art school. In these entire process of what my parents thought of my necessity to learn art skill, I never objected the idea of going to a school and learn art. But at the same time I was child enough and accepted what my parents thought was right at the time. Thus joining an art school for formal training wasn’t a bad idea. </p>
					<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:darkgray; font-weight: 300; font-size: large">My formal training started when I was in 7th grade and continued in the form of a 5-year diploma. My school was ran by Mr. Pranab Mullick. He is one of my teachers who left a deep impact in my life even after I finished my course. He needed to follow the board regulations but also gave us space to broaden our creativity. The art-form that I practice today has its originality and I would have never come up without the sense of freedom that I learned to nourish from him. My teacher used to say, “observe and follow people from who you think you can learn. Before making something unique you need to follow a lot of already established people and learn their life’s philosophy”. I have strongly followed that to date and always seek to learn the best in people around me. A thousands of observation always trigger uniqueness and all we need to do is to pay attention. In Indian culture there is a trend to do mehendi or henna tattoo over hands mostly during special occasions. This tradition has remained a trend for decades among women. When I was in 9th and 10th grade me and my friends used to be very passionate about drawing henna tattoos on each others’ arms with black gel pens. It used to feel like an addiction and we waited for a break or recess to get enough time to make the designs. Around the same time I felt a need to carry a small art journal in my back pack. </p>
