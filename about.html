					<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:darkgray; font-weight: 300; font-size: large"> I am Aratrika Ray-Dowling. On this portfolio website, 
						I showcase my fine arts projects, which I have been making since 2009. I am not an artist by profession. I make art projects in my leisure. You will peek into my 
						creative end if you are reading this page. Making art gives me a sense of freedom to express myself when words fall short and it also soothes my mind in my lows. 
						Sometimes I need to be pretty bold in flaunting this passion of my art-making as there are stereotypes that dictate that an engineer cannot be an artist in other 
						words if they are artists then in no way they are good engineers! Well, luckily I did not face a person who expressed this stereotype on my face but I am aware 
						that this thought process exists. Making art is such a refreshment that I ignore such stereotypes which shuts me in a box! The art form that is displayed in this 
						portfolio needed training, passion, and a trigger. I got training from professionals from a very young age. My parents always insisted that I would take an 
						interest in different activities beyond my formal education. They had exposed me to different cultural counterparts and art was one of those. There was also an 
						unsaid pressure from schoolwork that needed students to make scientific diagrams. The better the diagrams are, the better the grades will be! The education system 
						in India (where I am from) together with the parenting structure usually makes children look into different activities beyond studies quite deeply. When I was 
						around 5-6 years old a time came when those scientific diagrams in school would haunt me. A lot of my friends had already started taking training from art schools
						but I was yet to start. I remember my first scientific diagram was a water cycle whose neatness took me a lot of time to grasp. I expressed to my parents that I 
						needed to do good in those diagrams. My father taught me that while they searched for a good art school for my age, I could draw with dots and then later on join 
						them to make the final neat diagram. This way, erasing a few dots will be easier for correction and I can divide my diagram into smaller pieces. That worked well 
						for a while, but I later realized it was taking a long time! I remember I was little and was unable to draw 6 domestic animals as part of our life science 
						assignment. I remember that I was up all Friday night as I had never drawn an animal figure and I wondered how to draw all 6 of them in our interleaf workbook. 
						The assignment was due on Monday!

					<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:darkgray; font-weight: 300; font-size: large"> I was 6 years old when I first got into an art school 
						run by Mr. Nihar Chowdhury. He used to give us full freedom to draw whatever our hearts desired and then corrected them once we were done. He never scolded us and 
						he always had a smile on his face. I remember him saying at times, <i>“How did you do this (drawing)? I don’t think I can!”</i >. He suggested to my parents that 
						I seemed to be very skeptical about drawing and thus at that point this class should not be a formal regulation. So for me and some other little kids, he waived the yearly drawing 
						test. We used to be there to draw, watch different students’ art of various ages, and learn new tactics from him. As per my parents, the art school was a lot more 
						fun than they expected and maybe I am not learning much except being in that weekly class on Saturday morning where I am drawing whatever my heart wishes. Thus, I 
						joined another art school at the age of 9 run by Mr. Prasanth Mullick but left it after a year or so. I improved a lot even in that short span. My parents 
						observed that I am no longer scared of drawing and that my scientific diagrams are no more a nightmare! So it’s time to give all extra-curricular activities a gap 
						and focus on studies. A few years went by since then. I remember I used to draw by myself and missed going to art school. I understood that I had become stagnant and 
						not improving any further from that point, but then too I did not give up making art. Looking at this, when
						I was 13 my father again thought that I should start getting formal training from an art school. In this 
						entire process of what my parents thought of my necessity to learn art skills, I never objected to the idea of going to a school and learning art. But at the same 
						time, I was young enough to object to what my parents thought was right at the time. The breaks of changing one art school and then another bothered me. But the idea 
						of getting a chance to join an art school again, this time for formal training, made me eager.
					
					</p>
					
					<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:darkgray; font-weight: 300; font-size: large"> My formal training started when I was in 7th grade and 
						continued in the form of a 5-year diploma. My school was run by Mr. Pranab Mullick. He is one of my teachers who left a deep impact on my life even after I 
						finished my course. He needed to follow the board regulations but also gave us space to broaden our creativity. The art form that I practice today has its 
						originality which I would have never come up with without the sense of freedom that I learned to nourish from him. My teacher used to say to us, <i>“Observe and 
						follow people from whom you think you can learn. Before making something unique you need to follow a lot of established people and learn their life’s philosophy”.</i> 
						I have strongly followed that to date and always seek to learn the best in people around me. Thousands of observations always trigger uniqueness and all we need to 
						do is to pay attention.

					<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:darkgray; font-weight: 300; font-size: large"> In South Asian culture there is a trend to do <i>mehendi</i> or 
						<i>henna tattoo</i> over hands during special occasions. This tradition has remained a trend for decades. When I was in 9th and 10th grade me and my friends used to be very 
						passionate about drawing henna tattoos on each others’ palms with black gel pens. It used to feel like an addiction and we waited for a recess to get enough time to 
						make the designs. Around the same time, I felt the need to carry a small art journal in my backpack. The scribbles done in the journal and the daily dose of 
						appreciation from my friends after making a good henna tattoo triggered the start of my patterns. Following this in 2009, I started a diary of pen art to keep all my 
						patterns in one place, a lot of which are archived on this website. For a long time from 2009 to about 2015 I focused on making patterns that expressed a theme and 
						were not meant for traditional henna tattoos but of course, were inspired by it. But it all started because I received a lot of motivation from my friends and kept my 
						mind straight to start something new. The year 2009 also marks the end of my art diploma which means my guide or teacher will no more be there to point out the right 
						or wrong. Also, I did not want to pack my skill set in a loft at the end of my course! I wanted more! Maybe all these factors taken together pushed me to start the 
						form that I practice even today. Towards the end of my diploma, I showed a few of my pen art patterns from my diary to my teacher
						and all he said was, <i>"Are you sure you did this?! Oh my God!".</i> I told him the story of henna tattoos and how it all started. I was 
						very happy to see both appreciation and surprise in his eyes. This incident inspired me even further and made me believe that I am not
						doing anything foolish.
					
					</p>
					
					<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:darkgray; font-weight: 300; font-size: large">After some time I decided to broaden my art format and 
						understood that my uniqueness could be applied to a concept that will express itself as a message. Since then till now I have made conceptual art projects keeping 
						my form intact. The Instagram and Tumblr trend around 2016 of making pen art using pigma microns boomed all over the world where I saw there are so many artists 
						of various magnitudes who are embracing pen art on white medium as a sensation! I was happy to be part of them and of the fact that I have been thinking of an 
						up-to-date idea since 2009! Thereafter in 2016, I joined the Deviant Art community where there were artists from the very famous Leonid Afremov to artists like us. 
						One of my happiest days was when he took his precious time to look into my Deviant profile and liked one of my patterns (PATTERN 15). Joining that online art 
						community was the source of one of my biggest motivations where we would exchange llama badges to one another as a sign of appreciation. Deviant welcomes artists 
						from every country, artists with various concepts who use different mediums, artists of various magnitudes from novices to experts, and from casuals to 
						professionals. Unfortunately, I had to take a very long break from the Deviant art community in 2017 as I joined graduate studies. During the span of my 
						graduate studies, the only dedication I could have was to keep making projects with less frequency. But I never stopped making art though! Somewhere I can’t. 
						I may choose to make fewer friends but never stop finding time for my art!

					<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:darkgray; font-weight: 300; font-size: large">At this point, I realize that nothing works when 
						forced! I have seen a lot of elders pushing their young ones to do good in an activity or multiple of them beyond school work. In most cases, those pushes don’t 
						work. Rather than that I believe every individual has one or a few expertise which comes to them naturally as if they are destined to work on it. I was lucky to 
						have amazing art teachers who never imposed their formats on me. Rather they inspired me to find my own. It has not been possible for me to keep a constant 
						contact with them but I still carry their lessons with me. I carry on in making art projects and there is no end to learning new skills. 
						At the same time, my parents never threw a competition against a better artist or a better engineer to push me to do better. Today whatever I do, be it in my 
						professional life or as part of a cultural activity comes from my heart. It mostly gains completion and quality as it is not forced and it comes from my 
						willingness. My passion for the things I am good/fair at boosts my dedication. All of them started to appear in my life at the right time in the form of 
						opportunities, destiny, tutors, mentors, courses, traveling, and healthy relationships with inspiring individuals. I kept trying to grab the best of all the 
						possibilities and was as if just holding an empty bucket to receive all by paying unfailing attention.

					<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:darkgray; font-weight: 300; font-size: large">After the completion of my graduate studies in June 2023, 
						I thought of making this online art portfolio website to collect my projects in one place which have been made since 2009. It is a static website that I hosted on 
						GitHub after designing it. This portfolio contains all my projects and their information. I am a traditional artist although I deeply appreciate digital artists and 
						their art form. I just do not find the pen-on-paper shading strokes and their effects at their true level on digital platforms. Although there are other automated 
						features on digital art platforms that make it more efficient than traditional mediums. My projects can be viewed by clicking on <a href="work.html">Art Works</a>. I deeply hope that you 
						will enjoy going through them. Thank you for your interest in my projects.
