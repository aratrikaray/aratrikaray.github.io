					<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:darkgray; font-weight: 300; font-size: large">I am Aratrika Ray-Dowling.  On this portfoliowebsite I showcas my fine arts projects, which I have been making since 2009. I am not an artist by profession. I make art projects in my leisure. 
						You will peek into my creative end if you are reading this page. Making art gives me a sense of freedom to express myself when words fall short and it also soothes my mind in my lows. 
						Sometimes I need to be pretty bold in flaunting this passion of my art-making as there are stereotypes which dictate that an engineer cannot be an artist or in other words if they are artists then in no way they are good engineers! 
						Well, luckily I did not face a person yet who expressed this stereotype on my face but I am aware that this thought process exists. 
						Making art beside my original profession is such a refreshment that I ignore such stereotypes which shuts me in a box! The art-form that is displayed in this portfolio needed training, passion, and a trigger.  
						I got training from professionals since a very young age. My parents always insisted that I would take interest in different activities beyond my formal education. 
						They had exposed me to different cultural counterparts and art was one of those. 
						There was also an unsaid pressure from school-work that needed students to make scientific diagrams. The better the diagrams are, the better the grades will be! 
						The education system in India together with the parenting structure usually make children look into different activities beyond studies quite deeply. 
						When I was around 5-6 years old a time came when those scientific diagrams would haunt me. 
						A lot of my friends already started taking training from art schools but I was yet to start. 
						I remember my first scientific diagram was water cycle whose neatness took me a lot of time to grasp. 
						I expressed to my parents that I need to do good in those diagrams. 
						My father taught me that while they search for a good art school for my age, I can draw with dots and then later on join them to make the final neat diagram. 
						This way, erasing a few dots will be easier for correction and I can divide my diagram into smaller pieces. 
						That worked well for a while but later I realized that it was taking a long time! 
						I remember I was little and couldn’t draw 6 domestic animals as part of our life science assignment. 
						I remember that I was up all Friday night as I have never drawn an animal figure and I wondered how will I draw all 6 of them in our interleaf workbook. 
						The assignment was due on Monday!
						 </p>
					<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:darkgray; font-weight: 300; font-size: large">I was 6 years old when I first got in an art school ran by Mr. Nihar Chowdhury. 
						He used to give us full freedom to draw whatever our hearts desired and then corrected them once we were done. 
						He never scolded us and he always had a smile in his face. 
						I remember him saying at times, <i>“how did you do this? I don’t think I can!”</i>. 
						He suggested my parents that I seemed to be very skeptical about drawing and thus at that point this class should not be a formal regulation. 
						So for me and some other little kids he waived the yearly drawing test. We used to be there to draw, watch different students’ art of various ages, and to learn new tactics from him. 
						As per my parents that school was a lot more fun than they expected and maybe I am not learning much except being in that weekly class on Saturday morning where I am drawing whatever my heart wishes. Thus, I joined another art school at the age of 9 ran by Mr. Prasanth Mullick but left it after a year or so. 
						I improved a lot even in that short span. 
						My parents observed that I am no more scared of drawing and that my scientific diagrams are no more a nightmare! So it’s time to give all extra-curricular activities a gap and focus on studies. 
						A few years went by since then. 
						I was 13 when my father again thought that I should now start getting a formal training from an art school. In this entire process of what my parents thought of my necessity to learn art skill, I never objected the idea of going to a school and learn art. 
						But at the same time I was young enough to accept what my parents thought was right at the time. 
						The breaks of changing one art school and then another bothered me. 
						But the idea of getting a chance to join a formal art training school made me eager. </p>
					<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:darkgray; font-weight: 300; font-size: large">My formal training started when I was in 7th grade and continued in the form of a 5-year diploma. 
						My school was ran by Mr. Pranab Mullick. 
						He is one of my teachers who left a deep impact in my life even after I finished my course. 
						He needed to follow the board regulations but also gave us space to broaden our creativity. 
						The art-form that I practice today has its originality which I would have never come up without the sense of freedom that I learned to nourish from him. 
						My teacher used to say, <i>“observe and follow people from who you think you can learn. Before making something unique you need to follow a lot of established people and learn their life’s philosophy”</i>. 
						I have strongly followed that to date and always seek to learn the best in people around me. Thousands of observations always trigger uniqueness and all we need to do is to pay attention.   </p>
					<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:darkgray; font-weight: 300; font-size: large">In South Asian culture there is a trend to do <i>mehendi</i> or henna tattoo over hands during special occasions. 
						This tradition has remained a trend for decades. 
						When I was in 9th and 10th grade me and my friends used to be very passionate about drawing henna tattoos on each others’ palms with black gel pens. 
						It used to feel like an addiction and we waited for a recess to get enough time to make the designs. Around the same time I felt the need to carry a small art journal in my backpack. 
						The scribbles done in the journal and the daily dose of appreciation from my friends after making a good henna tattoo triggered the start of my unique patterns. 
						Following this in 2009, I started a diary of pen art to keep all my patterns in one place. 
						For a long time from 2009 to about 2015 I focused on making patterns which expressed a theme and were not meant for traditional henna tattoos. 
						But it all started because I received a lot of inspiration from my friends and kept my mind straight to start something new. 
						The year 2009 also marks the end of my art diploma which means my guide or teacher will no more be there to point out the right or wrong. Also I did not want to pack my skill set in a loft at the end of my course! I wanted more! 
						Maybe all these factors taken together pushed me to start my art-form that I practice even today.  </p>
					<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:darkgray; font-weight: 300; font-size: large">After some time I decided to broaden my art format and understood that the same uniqueness can be applied to a concept which will express itself as a message. 
						Since then till now I make conceptual art projects keeping my form intact. 
						The Instagram and Tumblr trend at around 2016 of making pen art using pigma microns boomed all over the world where I saw there are so many artists of various magnitudes who are embracing pen art on white medium as a sensation! 
						I was happy to be part of them and of the fact that I was thinking an up-to-date idea since 2009! Thereafter in 2016 I joined Deviant Art community where there were artists from the very famous Leonid Afremov to artists like us. 
						One of my happiest days was when he took his precious time to look into my Deviant profile and liked one of my patterns (PATTERN 15). Joining that online art community was the source of one of my biggest motivations where we would exchange llama badges to one another as a sign of appreciation. 
						Deviant welcomes artists from every country, artists with various concepts who use different mediums, artists of various magnitudes from novice to experts, and from casuals to professionals. 
						Unfortunately, I had to take a very long break from the art community from 2017 as I joined graduate studies. 
						During the span of my graduate studies, the only dedication I could have was to keep making projects with less frequency. 
						But I never stopped making art though! 
						Somewhere I can’t. 
						I may choose to make a few less friends but never stop finding time for my art! At this point I realize that nothing works when forced!
						I have seen a lot of elders pushing their young ones to do good in an activity or multiples of them.
						In most cases those pushes don’t work. 
						Rather than that I believe every individual has one or a few expertise which come(s) to them naturally as if they are destined to work on it. 
						I was lucky to have amazing art teachers who never imposed their formats on me. 
						Rather they inspired to find my own.
						At the same time my parents never threw a competition against a better artist or a better engineer to push me to do better. 
						Today whatever I do, be it in my professional life or as part of a cultural activity comes from my heart. 
						It mostly gains completion and quality as it is not forced and it comes from my willingness.
						My passion for the things I am good/fair at boosts my dedication. 
						All of them started to appear in my life at the right time in the form of opportunities, destiny, tutors, mentors, courses, traveling, and healthy relationships with inspiring individuals. 
						I was as if just holding an empty bucket by paying unfailing attention.  </p>
					<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:darkgray; font-weight: 300; font-size: large">After the completion of my graduate studies on June 2023, I thought of making this online art portfolio-website to collect my projects into one place which are made since 2009. 
						It is a static website which I hosted on Github after designing it. At the same time it can be customized as per my desire. This portfolio contains all my projects and their information. 
						I am a traditional artist although I deeply appreciate digital artists and their art-form. 
						I just do not find the pen on paper shading strokes and its effects at its authentic level on digital platforms. 
						Although there are other automated features on digital art platform which make it more efficient than traditional medium. 
						My projects can be viewed by clicking on <a href="work.html">Art Works</a>. 
						I deeply hope that you will enjoy going through them. 
						Thanking you for your interest in my projects. </p>
